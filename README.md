## Q-and-A's

### Lab 1

| Q  | A |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| There seems to be an error with the tests in github because the test would expect an odd number even though the test was for even numbers and vice versa. Is there a problem with the code or with the test sir?  | Please read the assignment carefully - we are expecting the ODD INDEXED elements (1,3,5,7, ... and so on), regardless whether they are odd numbers or not. On the other hand,  we are expecting the EVEN INDEXED elements (0, 2, 4, ...) as well.  |
